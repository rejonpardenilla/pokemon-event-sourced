Description:
    Generates the boilerplate code to add a new event sourced event to the stream.
    The first argument is the name of the event.
    The second argument is the name of the module of that event.
    If you don't specify the second argument then the event will be created under
    the `Default` module.

Example:
    rails generate event SomethingHappened Proposals

    This will:
        create  app/domain/events/proposals/something_happened.rb
        create  app/calculators/proposals/on_something_happened.rb
        insert  config/initializers/rails_event_store.rb
